# TesiMagistrale

This repo contains almost every code that has been written due to the production of my Master's degree thesis in Computer Science.
The main goal is to make a tedious work simple and reliable thanks to the Machine Learning algorithms.

This project takes news from reports made by an important Italian public istitution (**Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† - ISS**), categorizes it in specific classes derived from subsequent meetings, index it using a Solr istance and makes all the process described before briefly, available on a simple web server created with Flask.
